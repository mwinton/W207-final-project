# > **KEY OBSERVATION**: a hypothetical model that is hard-coded to predict a `negative` result every time would be ~77% accurate.  So, we should not accept any machine-learned model with a lower accuracy than that.  This also suggests that F1 score is a better metric to assess our work since it incorporates both precision and recall.

# > **KEY OBSERVATION**: the feature `school_income_estimate` only has non-null values for 104 of 371 records in the training data.  We should drop it from further analysis, as imputing its value for the non-null records isn't appropriate.

# > **KEY OBSERVATION**: while the accuracy is similar when we exclude zip code and school district, the F1 score is lower.  This suggests that it's important to keep these factors in the model. 

# ## Train a "race-blind" multilayer perceptron model
# Because we know there's an existing bias problem in the NYC schools, in that the demographics of the test taking population have been getting more homogenous, and the explicit goal of PASSNYC is to make the pool more diverse, we want to train a model that excludes most demographic features.  This would enable us to train a "race-blind" model.

# ## Experiment with dimensionality reduction via PCA
# Since manual feature selection performed poorly, resulting in a confidence interval of F1 spanning from 0 to 1 in both cases, it doesn't seem to be a promising approach.  Next, we experiment with Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, starting with the "naive" set of columns.

# ## Analyze false positives to make recommendations to PASSNYC
# False positives are the schools that our model predicted to have a high SHSAT registration rate, but in reality they did not.  This suggests that they have a lot in common with the high registration schools, but for some reason fall short.  As a result, we believe these are good candidates for the PASSNYC organization to engage with, as investing in programs with these schools may be more highly to payoff with increase registration rates.  We will prioritize the schools based on features that align with the PASSNYC diversity-oriented mission.
