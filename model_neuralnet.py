# > **KEY OBSERVATION**: a hypothetical model that is hard-coded to predict a `negative` result every time would be ~77% accurate.  So, we should not accept any machine-learned model with a lower accuracy than that.  This also suggests that F1 score is a better metric to assess our work since it incorporates both precision and recall.

# > **KEY OBSERVATION**: the feature `school_income_estimate` only has non-null values for 104 of 371 records in the training data.  We should drop it from further analysis, as imputing its value for the non-null records isn't appropriate.

# ## Create a function to estimate MLP models and report results
# We create a pipeline that will be used for k-fold cross-validation.  First, we scale the features, then perform dimensionality reduction by PCA if requested by the caller, then estimate a multilayer perceptron neural network with the hidden layers defined by the caller. Once the pipeline is built, we perform cross-validation, print the results, and return key statistics.

# For the first model, we'll use all features except SHSAT-related features because they are too correlated with the way we calculated the label.  We'll also drop `school_income_estimate` because it's missing for ~2/3 of the schools.  We drop zip code (too granular to have many schools per zip) in favor of the indicator variables `in_[borough]`.

# ## One hot encode the categorical explanatory variables
# Columns such as zip code and school district ID, which are integers, should not be fed into an ML model as integers.  Instead, we need to treat them as factors and perform one-hot encoding.  Since we have already removed zip code from our dataframe (in favor of boroughs), we only need to one hot encode `district`.

# While the accuracy is similar to the first model, the F1 score is lower.  This suggests that it's important to keep location-oriented factors in the model. 

# ## Train a "race-blind" multilayer perceptron model
# Because we know there's an existing bias problem in the NYC schools, in that the demographics of the test taking population have been getting more homogenous, and the explicit goal of PASSNYC is to make the pool more diverse, we want to train a model that excludes most demographic features.  This would enable us to train a "race-blind" model.  
# 
# ### Preprocess new X_train and X_test datasets

# The F1 score for the race-blind model declines further when we remove these features.  Of the models we have tested, the original "naive" model (with the most features) performs better than our race-blind model, or our model that excluded only zip and district.

# ## Experiment with dimensionality reduction via PCA
# Since manual feature selection performed poorly, it doesn't seem to be a promising approach.  Instead, we will experiment with Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, starting with the "naive" set of columns.

# Determine the number of principal components to achieve 90% explained variance

# Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction, in contrast to manual feature selection, seemed to improve our results.  

# ## Use grid search to identify best set of hidden layer parameters
# Since the usage of PCA seemed to improve our F1 score (and tighten its confidence interval), we will proceed to optimize the hidden layer parameters while using PCA and the original "naive" feature set.

# ## Prioritized Engagement recommendations
# 
# Lastly, according to the methodology described in our [overview notebook](final_project_overview.ipynb), we will make our recommendations to PASSNYC based on an analysis of schools that the models show to have the highest opportunity to engage with Black and Hispanic students, in order to increase SHSAT registration in this population. We consider these to be the schools that are most likely to benefit from PASSNYC's intervention and engagement.
