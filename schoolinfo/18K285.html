<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Frederick A. Underwood succeeded Edward Gentile as principal of IS 285. The school shares the building with <a href="middle/browse/school/706">MS 57 The Ron Brown Academy</a> and with the <a href="high/browse/school/1598">Brooklyn Academy of Global Finance</a>.</p> <p><strong>FEBRUARY 2005 REVIEW: </strong>Many schools are housed in older buildings, a fact they would change if they could, but IS 285 seems to like its well-maintained surroundings just the way they are. Principal Edward Gentile began the morning of our visit with announcements on what is likely the original PA system, or at least the same system that was there when Gentile arrived at the school as a teacher in 1978. (He became principal in fall 2002.) After reciting The Pledge of Allegiance and recognizing a student who had been accepted to the Bronx High School of Science, he urged all students to resist the temptation to ease up on their academic efforts, now that testing season was over. "It's not the end of the road at Meyer Levin," he said.</p> <p>Whether because of its traditional atmosphere or something else, IS 285 has a safety record to be proud of, and students on our visit were well behaved. The principal attributes the sense of order to school staffing there are three full-time deans and security guards and such school policies as its dress code. Student work displayed in the hallways was protected and preserved, each covered with a layer of plastic.</p> <p>The school has a long way to go, however, in boosting student performance. Its overall results on the city and state standardized tests are disappointing, with fewer than one third of the students scoring at or above grade level in math or reading in 2004. The school hopes to address this in part with the help of a new math teacher who recently started at the school, Gentile said.</p> <p>There was a paucity of posted work at the school, but teachers said this was partially a matter of the timing of our visit toward the end of the month, when decorations and work displays are changed. Classrooms displayed less work than we would have liked to have seen.</p> <p>Launched with magnet school funding in the 1980s, the school's performing arts program has been kept intact. After losing its magnet status, IS 285 nonetheless continued drama classes and large-scale performances. Band and steel drum electives the latter highly popular with students, many of whom come from West Indian backgrounds also remain. During our visit, the school auditorium was being remodeled, so students were practicing in a nearby high school for their end-of-the-year performance of the 1983 Broadway musical, "<em>The Tap Dance Kid</em>." A new science room was also in finishing stages when we saw it, evidence that while tradition is celebrated at the school, change does come. "They move you into positions that fit your teaching style," a computer teacher at the school told us, explaining that she liked to allow her class to be able to get up, walk around, and work independently. Some students in her 7th grade class worked on papers and PowerPoint presentations as a group, while others worked on their own.</p> <p>The teacher of a 7th grade Astral class an accelerated program offered at the school explained interior angles of a polygon, as the class quietly paid attention. One administrator pointed out that another teacher we observed was using a lecturing style better suited for high school. "Middle school is more visual than high school," the administrator said, adding that the problem was being addressed with the teacher.</p> <p>At IS 285, professional development for newer teachers takes place in a special classroom, where master teachers conduct classes under observation. "It's a good way to teach teachers," the principal said. However, the room is not used very often, as many teachers don't leave the school until they retire. Another interesting phenomenon about the preserved culture at Meyer Levin School: four teachers we found had attended the school themselves, and two had had Gentile as a teacher. "I didn't want to be a teacher until I could teach here," said Tanisha Gordon, a 6th grade Astral teacher, who waited after earning her teaching degree until there was an opening at IS 285.</p> <p>Parent coordinator Donna Philips also seemed pleased to be at the school. She told us she could be happier about parent turnout at monthly workshops and parent association meetings, but said she understood that many parents in the community are unable to attend because of busy work schedules. Philips said that she gets support from both teachers and the principal, and feels comfortable raising any concern. Recently, one parent called because she had left for work early and hoped to drop off her daughter, but found the doors of the school locked. Arrangements were made for a security guard to unlock the door early, so the student could wait inside. "If the parent makes it known, something will be done about it," Philips said.</p> <p>The recent generation of students can be a bit more disruptive than earlier generations, according to those long familiar with the school. Philips meets with many of the students for a variety of reasons and describes them as nice kids, but noticed that the more recent classes "seem more defiant." Gordon, having attended the school as a student, lent us her own insight, "A lot of our parents were immigrants," she explained. "Now they seem more Americanized."</p> <p><strong>Special education:</strong> There is one "self-contained" classroom only for students with special needs for each grade, and two teachers who meet individually with students. (<em>Paul Burkhardt, February 2005</em>)</p>
